# Blender event display — H → ττ reconstruction

A cinematic 3-D visualisation of the reconstruction method used in this
analysis, built from a **real Monte-Carlo event** (not a cartoon) and rendered
with Cycles in 4K inside a Blender Docker image.

The shots tell the story in several beats:

| Output | Beat |
|---|---|
| `01_event_display` (.png / .mp4) | The lab-frame event `e⁺e⁻ → ZH → μ⁺μ⁻ τ⁺τ⁻`, beam horizontal. The Z→μμ "tag" fixes the Higgs 4-momentum; each τ flies a short distance and decays to `π ν`. |
| `02_reconstruction_geometry` (.png / .mp4) | The Jeans impact-parameter method for one τ: the measured π track misses the primary vertex by **d**; the τ flight, the opening angle **α**, and **L = \|d\|/sin α** form a right triangle in a translucent track plane. |
| `03_higgs_rest_frame` (.png / .mp4) | Boosted into the Higgs rest frame the two τ's are **back-to-back**, each ≈ M_H/2. |
| `04_boost_to_rest_frame.mp4` | The boost itself: the lab-frame τ momenta morph into the back-to-back rest-frame configuration. |
| `05_decay_planes` (.png / .mp4) | Rest frame: the two **translucent τ decay planes** hinged on the common τ axis and the **single acoplanarity angle φ** between them. |
| `05_zoom_to_impact_parameters.mp4` | Animated dolly from the wide rest-frame view down into the vertex region where the impact parameters live. |
| `06_decay_planes_axial` (.png) | The same decay planes viewed **down the τ axis** — the classic "clock face" where the one angle φ is unmistakable. |
| `07_event_angular` (.png) | The lab event display without the resolved displacement (pions drawn straight from the PV). |
| storyboard `01 … 06` (.png) | The **pedagogical storyboard** — one rendered frame per step of the method (see below). |
| `tautau_event.blend` | The full Blender scene, for opening / tweaking by hand. |

### The step-by-step storyboard (`--shot steps`)

A clean diagram per step, in narrative order, **all in the Higgs rest frame**
after the boost.  No step-number captions — each frame carries only its
physics labels, so the sequence can be narrated however you like.

| Frame | Diagram |
|---|---|
| `00_lab_event` | The lab event: μ⁺μ⁻ from the Z and τ⁺τ⁻ from the Higgs (beam horizontal) |
| `01_what_is_measured` | What a detector **actually measures**: the four charged tracks, the primary vertex and the pion impact parameters (solid/bright); the τ flights, decay vertices and neutrinos are **inferred** (faint ghosts) |
| `02_measure_the_muons` | Highlight the Z→μ⁺μ⁻ measurement and the Higgs recoil `p_H = p_beam − p_Z` (tau side ghosted) — "we measure the muons, which fixes the Higgs momentum…" |
| `03_boost_to_rest_frame` | "…and that lets us boost into the Higgs rest frame": τ's back-to-back, `|p| ≈ M_H/2` (muons still shown) |
| `04_higgs_rest_frame` | Muons removed — the Higgs decay in its own frame |
| `05_decay_planes` | Each τ decay spans a **plane**, shown with the real (displaced) decays sitting inside the two translucent planes |
| `06_acoplanarity` | The **single** acoplanarity angle φ between the two planes (3/4 "book" view) |
| `07_acoplanarity_axial` | The same planes viewed down the τ axis — the "clock face", one angle unmistakably |
| `08_impact_parameters` | **Zoom in**: each pion's impact parameter d, sitting inside its decay plane |
| `09_decay_locations` | The payoff: d and the opening angle α pin down where each τ decayed — `L = |d|/sin α`, planes shown |

Standalone `--shot measurable` and `--shot measure-muons` render those
lab-frame slides on their own.

Physics conventions match the analysis (`spin_analysis.py`): the common axis
k̂ is the τ⁻ direction in the Higgs frame, both pions' azimuths are measured
about it, and the displayed φ is exactly the analysis acoplanarity.  Labels are **generic** (no specific numbers) so the figures are a stand-in for any event, while still being this real event's geometry.  The
rest-frame opening angles α and decay lengths L are the reconstructed values
(Lorentz-boosted into the Higgs frame by `extract_event.py`).  The displayed
rest-frame space is rotated so the τ axis is world-X (horizontal in frame,
level horizon) and the decay planes open symmetrically upward.

In the Higgs rest frame the two τ's are **exactly back-to-back** with equal
momenta (|p| = M_H/2) — that is an exact consequence of momentum conservation,
so the diagram draws it that way rather than advertising the small residual
from reconstructing the two τ's independently.  Each τ's decay is then laid out
on the common axis at its reconstructed L and α, with the pion in the plane
spanned by that axis and its azimuth q̂; so each **decay plane has an edge along
the τ momentum and entirely contains that τ's pion vector**, and the right
triangle giving `L = |d|/sin α` holds by construction.  Labels render with real
sub/superscripts (e.g. M_H, p_H = p_beam − p_Z), not ASCII underscores.

## Look & feel

- **Modern type** — labels use Inter (bundled at `/opt/fonts/label.ttf`), with
  real Greek/symbol glyphs (μ, τ, π, ν, **α**, **φ**) and screen-aligned,
  carefully placed text.
- **Warm light, native temperature** — lights use Blender's *actual* colour
  temperature controls (`use_temperature` + `temperature` in Kelvin; requires
  Blender ≥ 4.5): a 3100 K warm key, a 3600 K top fill and a 4500 K rim.
- **Softly lit dome** — the whole scene sits inside a giant sphere whose warm
  vertical emission gradient is both a wraparound softbox and a seamless
  cyclorama backdrop; a low-albedo ground catches **soft shadows**.
- **Horizontal beam** — a physics→scene axis remap (`beam → +X`) keeps the beam
  axis horizontal in every frame.
- **Sophisticated decay planes** — translucent tinted glass panels with glowing
  rims and normal indicators; the angle between them (acoplanarity) is drawn
  with a proper **φ** symbol, and the per-τ opening angle with **α**.
- **Satin-matte materials**, **cinematic shallow DOF** (9-blade bokeh), slow
  ease-in-out camera moves, **motion blur** on all animations.
- Cycles 4K, rendered as a **single tile** (auto-tiling off) so Cycles never
  spills its accumulation buffer to a temp `.exr` — that disk round-trip fails
  on some systems (notably macOS) with "Error writing tile to file".
- One consistent palette (τ⁻ teal, τ⁺ orange, μ blue, Higgs/vertex gold,
  ν pale grey, reconstruction magenta, angles warm amber); subjects composed
  on the left/right third for slide backgrounds.

## Running it

By default `render.sh` fetches Blender on the host, builds a Docker image, and
renders inside it (the committed `data/event.json` is used as-is):

```bash
cd blender
./render.sh                       # all stills + storyboard + boost animation
./render.sh steps 160             # the 10-frame step-by-step storyboard
./render.sh stills 160            # the standalone still frames
./render.sh anims 96 GPU          # the animations, on the GPU
./render.sh planes 192            # a single still
```

Shots: `event`, `reco`, `rest`, `planes`, `planes-axial`, `event-angular`
(stills, plus `measure-muons`) · `steps` (the 10-frame storyboard) · `event-anim`, `reco-anim`,
`rest-anim`, `planes-anim`, `boost`, `zoom` (animations) · `stills`, `anims`,
`all`.

### Running without Docker (`--host`)

Pass `--host` to skip Docker and render with a Blender already installed on
this machine — handy on a Mac, where Docker can't reach the GPU and Blender's
own Metal backend can:

```bash
./render.sh steps 200 GPU --host
```

The flag may appear anywhere on the command line. The script looks for Blender
on `PATH` and at the standard macOS location
(`/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender`); override with
`BLENDER_BIN=/path/to/blender`. Blender ≥ 4.5 is required (native light
temperature). The bundled `fonts/label.ttf` is picked up automatically.

### GPU rendering (for the finals)

Pass `GPU` as the third argument. Inside Docker this needs the NVIDIA container
runtime (Linux only); with `--host` it uses whatever backend Blender finds
(OPTIX → CUDA → HIP → METAL → ONEAPI). You can also drive Blender directly:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all -v "$PWD/blender":/work tautau-blender \
    -b -P /work/build_scene.py -- --shot anims --samples 128 --device GPU
```

`--device GPU` auto-selects OPTIX → CUDA → HIP → METAL → ONEAPI, falling back
to CPU if none is found.

### `build_scene.py` arguments (after the `--`)

| Arg | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--shot` | `all` | shot name or group (see above) |
| `--samples` | `128` | Cycles samples (adaptive + OpenImageDenoise on top) |
| `--res-percent` | `100` | resolution scale (use ~30 for quick previews) |
| `--device` | `CPU` | `CPU` or `GPU` |
| `--frame-start` / `--frame-end` | `1` / `96` | animation frame range |
| `--fps` | `24` | animation frame rate |

## Notes

- Built and tested against **Blender 4.5.10 LTS** (needed for native light
  temperature). The Inter font is committed under `fonts/`.
- CPU previews work fine at reduced `--res-percent`; the 4K finals and the
  ~100-frame animations are GPU territory.
- `blender.tar.xz` and everything under `output/` are git-ignored; rerun
  `render.sh` to regenerate them.
